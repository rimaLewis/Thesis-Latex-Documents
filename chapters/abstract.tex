Non-functional properties of a configurable software system are as important as functional properties. A configurable software system has several configurable options that can be selected or deselected.When the configuration options are selected they may have an impact on the performance and energy consumption of the software system. Performance and energy consumption are the most important non-functional properties of a software system. When two or more configuration options are selected at the same time, they may interact which is called an interaction.We use a machine learning algorithm to derive the performance-influence models, these models are then visualized to see how the configuration options and interactions have an impact on the total performance and energy consumption of the configurable software system.

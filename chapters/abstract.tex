Configurable software systems have various configuration options such as encryption and compression. These configuration options and their interactions may have an influence on the non-functional properties of the system like performance or energy consumption. We use performance-influence models to interpret and understand the performance influences of certain configuration options or interactions on the non-functional properties of the system. However, the increasing complexity of performance-influence models for complex configurable software systems turns the interpretation into a difficult task. Therefore, as a solution to this issue, we present a tool to visualize the performance-influence models to make it easier to interpret them. For this thesis, we select 3 different visualization techniques. To demonstrate their usefulness, we validate these visualization techniques by performing an interview. In general, we find that one of the visualization technique outperformed the other in interpreting performance-influence models, but all the 3 visualization techniques certainly make interpreting performance-influence models easier.
